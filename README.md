- Windows: Zero effort, no tests before release, if stuff breaks - too bad, it's up to you to contribute fixes

## Installation

1. Download an archive from [releases](https://github.com/ambiso/opendeck-akp05/releases)
2. In OpenDeck: Plugins -> Install from file
3. Download [udev rules](./40-opendeck-akp05.rules) and install them by copying into `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and running `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
4. Unplug and plug again the device, restart OpenDeck

## Knob LED configuration

By default no LED commands are sent, so the device keeps its own built-in effect.

To configure the knob LEDs, create `~/.config/opendeck-akp05/leds.toml`.
(Windows: `%APPDATA%\opendeck-akp05\leds.toml`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/opendeck-akp05/leds.toml`)

All LEDs the same color:

```toml
brightness = 100 # 0-100

[mode.Static]
colors = [[255, 0, 128]] # RGB
```

Each LED a different color:

```toml
brightness = 100 # 0-100

[mode.Static]
colors = [
    [255, 0,   0  ], # RGB knob 1
    [0,   255, 0  ], # RGB knob 2
    [0,   0,   255], # RGB knob 3
    [255, 255, 0  ], # RGB knob 4
]
```

When OpenDeck is being terminated, a disconnect signal is sent to the device, which results in a hardcoded red for all knobs.
